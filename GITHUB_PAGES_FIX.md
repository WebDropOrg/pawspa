# GitHub Pages Jekyll Fix

## 🐛 Problem

You were getting this error when deploying to GitHub Pages:

```
Run bundle exec jekyll build --baseurl "/pawspa"
Could not locate Gemfile or .bundle/ directory
Error: Process completed with exit code 10.
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

GitHub Pages **automatically tries to build Jekyll sites** by default. However, this is a modern **React/Vite application**, not a Jekyll site. The error occurred because GitHub Pages was looking for Jekyll files (Gemfile, \_config.yml) that don't exist in a React project.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Disabled Jekyll Processing**

- Added `.nojekyll` file to `public/` directory
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to create `.nojekyll` in build output
- This tells GitHub Pages: "This is NOT a Jekyll site, serve files as-is"

### 2. **Updated Base Path**

- Changed from `/petco/` to `/pawspa/` in `vite.config.ts`
- Updated all documentation to reflect new repository name
- Ensured assets are properly prefixed for GitHub Pages

### 3. **Fixed Deployment Workflow**

- Added step to create `.nojekyll` file during build process
- Workflow now properly handles React/Vite builds instead of Jekyll

## 📁 Files Modified

- ✅ `vite.config.ts` - Updated base path to `/pawspa/`
- ✅ `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Added `.nojekyll` creation step
- ✅ `public/.nojekyll` - Created to disable Jekyll processing
- ✅ `README.md` - Updated repository URLs
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Updated deployment documentation

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Commit and push these changes** to your main branch
2. **GitHub Actions will automatically**:

   - Build the React app with correct base path
   - Create `.nojekyll` file to disable Jekyll
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages

3. **Your site will be live at**: `https://WebDropOrg.github.io/pawspa/`

## 🔧 What The Fix Does

### Before (Broken):

```
GitHub Pages: "I see some files, let me build this as Jekyll..."
GitHub Pages: "Where's the Gemfile? Error!"
```

### After (Working):

```
GitHub Pages: "I see a .nojekyll file, this is a static site"
GitHub Pages: "Serving React app as-is ✅"
```

## 📊 Verification

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Site loads at `https://WebDropOrg.github.io/pawspa/`
- [ ] Navigation works between pages
- [ ] All assets (CSS, JS, images) load correctly
- [ ] No Jekyll-related errors in Actions logs

The `.nojekyll` file is the key - it's an empty file that tells GitHub Pages to skip Jekyll processing and serve your React build directly.
